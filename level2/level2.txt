//Level 2 Process

1. What is the DOM?
// DOM stands for document object module.
// DOM is a platform as well as a language-neutral interface
// that allows/ helps programs and scripts to access and update
// content, structure and style in a document.

2. List three methods to manipulate the DOM.
// 1. createElement();
// 2. createTextNode();
// 3. querySelectorAll();

3. What is an asynchronous call?
// A asynchronous call is when some code is taking some time to finish (like accessing an API or
// reading content from the local file system) is being executed in the background
// and in parallel the code execution is continued. 
// This behaviour is being described by term asynchronous programming.

4. Briefly explain what the sources tab in Chromes Developers Tools does.
// you can use the sources tab in Chromes developer tools in several ways:
// you can for example; view files, edit CSS and JavaScript and debug JavaScript.

5. What is a JavaScript promise?
// the promise object in JS is used 
// to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
// Promise in JS can also provide better error handeling than
// callbacks and events.

6. What is an API?
// API stands for Application Program Interface.
// An API allows software to communicatre with another software.

7. What is a JavaScript Event?
// is handeling the interaction between a JS file and an HTML 
// document.
// In other words: Javascript has events to 
// provide a dynamic interface to a webpage. 
// 'onclick' is one example of a JS event.

8. What is event bubbling?
// When an event happens on an element, it first runs the 
// handlers on it, then on its parent, 
// then all the way up on other ancestors.
// In JS events “bubble” from the inner 
// element up through parents like a bubble in the water.
